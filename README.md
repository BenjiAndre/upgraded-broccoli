# upgraded-broccoli

The goal of this exercise is to produce a **pedagogical** rootkit, which means I'm allowed to do some ugly stuff for ease of use. As the documentation is a huge part of the grade, I'll do my best to explain absolutely EVERYTHING, my life included, as it's by far the most interesting part of this project. For now I don't know what form the documentation will take, but you can expect it to be something stupid.
